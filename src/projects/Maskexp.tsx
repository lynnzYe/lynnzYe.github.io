              Creating and listening to expressive renderings of composed
              musical pieces are two fundamental ways of how we express and
              experience music. Many studies delved into building computational
              models of musical expressiveness for a better understanding of its
              nature as well as possible downstream applications. This paper
              seeks to model expressiveness through a novel approach that is
              similar to the way pianists plan and execute their expressive
              intentions: conditionally generating the piano key striking
              velocity, a key parameter contributing to expressiveness, through
              masked language modeling with vanilla BERT. The result reveals
              that the model is capable of predicting velocity events
              conditioned on the surrounding context within an acceptable margin
              of error, as well as generating more musically convincing velocity
              events on unseen MIDIs though sequential masking and prediction.
              Such an approach can be useful for a series of tasks, including
              helping us build more advanced piano conducting or accompaniment
              systems and understand expressiveness through the conditioned
              generation.

              The project uses a vanilla BERT model for masked language
              modeling. Although the primary task is to predict velocity tokens,
              masking all types of tokens prevents significant mode collapse.

            <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold pb-1">Generation</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              To generate a complete expressive performance, the model needs to
              be adapted due to the limited input size. A naïve approach
              involves breaking an input sequence into non-overlapping chunks
              and ask the model to replace velocity mask tokens with predicted
              tokens.

            />
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              However, because the information from other chunks is not
              available, nor does the surrounding velocity information (they get
              predicted all at once), the model can hardly reconstruct a
              musically coherent performances. A solution to this is by
              "multi-trial prediction with overlapping chunks", meaning that the
              input sequence is divided into overlapping segments, and the model
              only replaces a small proportion of the velocity mask tokens at a
              time. After multiple rounds of predictions, all velocity mask
              tokens will be eventually replaced.

            Users are expected to provide a partial MIDI performance and the
            corresponding musical score (in xml format). If the score is too
            complex to be aligned, you may instead provide a MIDI version of the
            score, which usually results in more accurate alignment result given
            that the performed MIDI is an incomplete fraction of the score.
