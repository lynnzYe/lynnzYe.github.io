        My name is Linzan Ye. I am currently pursing an M.S. degree in Music and
        Technology at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Roger
        Dannenberg and Chris Donahue. As a music enthusiast, I am fascinated by
        how music helps us communicate our emotions and connect with others. My
        goal is to contribute to the development of AI companions that help
        minimize the barriers to self-expression.
